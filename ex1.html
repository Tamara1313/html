 <p> <font face="broadway" or... a great place to check out while skiing in Austria. </font></p>
 <p>One of the worse things to have during a ski vacation, you’d been waiting for so long, is to get your knee injured.
     And this is exactly what happened to me during my last time in Austria. So,i had about 9 days left, a car and my camera.
     Alps...are good not only for skiing.
     There’s something special about being in the mountains. The crispy fresh air, breathtaking views and majestic heights  
     of powdered peacks are perfect to take some good landscape photos and it's all yours to explore without any 
     selfie sticks or tourists groups getting in. 
     As i'm addicted to driving and music, it worked great for me as well.
     And one of those days, while driving, enjoying the sweeping views and looking for a place to have a lunch...
     What a find!
     i'd never expect to find a motorbike themed restaurant !!! And even more, there’s a whole Motorbike Museum next door !!!</p><br>

<p>First of all, you don't have to be a fan of two-wheeled vehicles to go into a rapture here.
   The building itself is a work of art and the restaurant is equally stunning.
   Even the architecture of the showroom is remarkable, not talking about the exclusive exhibits. Over 230 historic motorcycles of more than 100 different
   manufacturers as well as a number of automotive rarities can be admired on the 3000 m² exhibition area.
   The restaurant is next to the ski slope. When entering, you'll see a lot of bikes, a stove and decorated heads of animals.
   with many artefacts from the museum on full display around the restaurant itself. High wooden ceilings create a warm, 
   impressive background to the exhibits.
   Definitely a select spot for lunch. The food is really good and you can get a local dishes as well as a typical dishes like spaghetti, salads,pizza and etc.
