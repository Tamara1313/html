 <p> <i><b>Alps...during the winter months, Alps - it's a land of almost unlimited opportunities: from sport to fine dining, adrenalie junkies to culture vultures.
     There’s something special about being in the mountains. The crispy fresh air, breathtaking views and majestic heights of snow capped peacks, are perfect to take some good landscape photos and it's all yours to explore, without any selfie sticks or tourist groups getting in.
 </i></b></p>
    
 <p> <i><b>But whether you are skiing in the area or just driving, enjoying the sweeping views and looking for a place to have a lunch, there is a superb place to check out.
     You'd never expected to find a motorbike themed restaurant! And even more, there’s a whole Motorbike museum next door!   
     Top Mountain Motorcycle Museum Crosspoint, located at the top of The Timmelsjoch Pass(Austria-Italy),just before the toll booth in the Austrian side.  
   </i></b></p>   

<p> <i><b>First of all, you don't have to be a fan of two-wheeled vehicles to go into a rapture here.
    The building itself is a work of art and the restaurant is equally stunning.
    Even the architecture of the showroom is remarkable, not talking about the exclusive exhibits. 

    The restaurant is next to the ski slope. When entering, you'll see a lot of bikes, a stove and decorated heads of animals, with many artefacts from the museum on full display around the restaurant itself. 
    High wooden ceilings create a warm, impressive background to the exhibits.
    The food is very 
    you can get a typical dishes like spaghetti, salads and pizza, but 
    eating warm and delicious Alpine food will surely hit the spot after a long day of skiing !
